# PaperMC Manager TUI

A small TUI application to manage [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper) versions.
It allows you to check the latest stable version and build as well as downloading the latest stable build.

When downloading a new version, it will prompt for a backup so that you can easily revert back to the previous version.

That's it! Simply compile and run the binary - I'm too lazy to set up a release :')
